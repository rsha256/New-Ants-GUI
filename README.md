# New-Ants-GUI
I noticed the ants project didn't have some features seen in previous ant projects, to name a few:
<ul>
<li>The new ant graphics!!<br />

<li>Names of the ants above without having to click on them<br />

<li>TankAnt covered up ants behind it making it impossible to see what ant you had placed there &mdash; I altered the frames of the gif in GIMP and made it translucent (I also made BodyguardAnt aligned right on top of the head of each of the ants, in such a cute manner, see bottom photo):<br />

<li>A new water color (you can customize the color by ctrl+f'ing <kbd>change water color here </kbd>in ants_gui.py):<br />
<img src="https://github.com/rsha256/New-Ants-GUI/blob/master/docs/water.png?raw=true" alt="image.png" /></li>
<li>Changed the select color to green:<br />

<li>Other misc features

I also made an autoinstall script named anime.sh to thank Animesh for letting me know about the Fall 2019 graphic files but then I accidentally rm'd the script (RIP) so I hosted the relevant files on GitHub here: <a href="https://github.com/rsha256/New-Ants-GUI">https://github.com/rsha256/New-Ants-GUI</a>

For those wondering the only things I changed were ants_gui.py and assets/ so you should be able to just add your own ants.py (I have the locked tests/ dir in here so you will need to <strong>also</strong> reunlock tests or copy-paste your tests/ dir as well to get it to submit)!

I made this open-source so the instructors could use these graphics in the future, if people think this is cool â€” also feel free to make an issue/PR for more features!</li>
</ul>
